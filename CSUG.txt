  * MANAGE_USERS: User administration
- Added JWT-based authentication with token management
- Implemented session handling with expiration
- Added permission validation and checking

2. Business Rules Engine (rules_engine.py)
----------------------------------------

  * Grade requirements
  * Credit value rules
  * Course equivalency
  * Institution-specific rules
  * Time-based restrictions
  * Program requirements
- Implemented priority-based rule execution (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Added rule condition management and evaluation
- Included common rule conditions:
  * Minimum grade requirements
  * Credit value validation
  * Time limit checking
  * Institution approval verification

3. Audit Logging System (audit.py)
--------------------------------
- Implemented comprehensive event tracking with six event types:
  * User access events
  * Data access events
  * Data change events
  * System configuration events
  * Security events
  * Evaluation events
- Added severity levels (Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
- Implemented structured logging with file and console output
- Added query capabilities with filtering
- Included report generation with statistics

4. API Rate Limiting (rate_limit.py)
----------------------------------
- Implemented token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- Added Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- Created configurable limits:
  * Default: 100 requests/hour
  * Authenticated: 1000 requests/hour
  * Burst: 50 requests/minute
- Added limit tracking and violation handling
- Implemented context manager for easy usage

5. Caching System (cache.py)
---------------------------
- Implemented dual-backend caching:
  * In-memory cache for development
  * Redis-based cache for production
- Added TTL-based expiration
- Implemented cache key management
- Added cache statistics tracking
- Created decorator for easy function result caching
