            Extract ALL information from this transcript. If the data has watermark, please read grade, course code, course name, credits, grade, term, year, and transfer details carefully.
            If it's examination like AP, make sure you to include exam name, grade and year taken  in the `Course Information` section.
            
            For transfer credits:
            - Look for explicit mentions of "transfer", "transferred from", or similar phrases
            - Check for course codes or prefixes from other institutions
            - Look for any indicators in the transcript key that denote transfer credits
            - Pay attention to different institution names listed with courses
            
            For course codes:
            - Look for alphanumeric combinations in formats like:
            * MATH1310 (letters followed directly by numbers)
            * PEB 1138 (letters, space, then numbers)
            * SPAN 1301 (subject code followed by course number)
            - Course codes may appear before or after course names
            - Some codes may have spaces between letters and numbers, others may not

            For grades:
            - Look for letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) with optional +/- modifiers
            - Look for numerical grades (e.g., 4.0, 3.0)
            - Look for special grades (P/Pass, CR/Credit, W/Withdrawn)
            - Check for grades both after course details and in separate columns
            - Grade may appear after course name or on a separate line. Make sure you read the grade completely and correctly.


            For Year:
            - Look for the year the course was taken
            - Check for year after course details or in a separate column
            - Year may appear after course name or on a separate line. Make sure you read the year completely and correctly.
            - Year could be mentioned in the term as 16/FA which could mean 2016 Fall, extract 2016 as year

            For Term:
            - Look for the term the course was taken
            - Check for term after course details or in a separate column
            - Term may appear after course name or on a separate line. Make sure you read the term completely and correctly.
            - Term could be mentioned in the term as 16/FA which could mean 2016 Fall, extract 'Fall' as term
